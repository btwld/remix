## 1.0.0-beta.10

- **BREAKING**: Align Fortal icon button sizes to 12/16/20 pixels and apply tab container styling to custom tab children; use the builder escape hatch for fully custom tab rendering.
- Preserve inherited menu item styles, root menu and table variants, and tooltip text defaults.

- Add controlled sidebar collapse, coordinated width/content transitions configured with AnimationStyle, accessible icon-only destinations, and styled tooltips.
- Add controlled tooltip visibility and preserve enclosing dismissal actions when closed.
- Add `RemixToastScope`, `showRemixToast`, and the stateless `RemixToast`: queued, nonmodal notifications over `NakedToastScope` with six directional placements, same-id replacement, pause on hover, focus, and background, status or alert announcements, and composed action and close buttons styled through `ToastSpec`. Requires `naked_ui` 1.0.0-beta.15.
- Export `RemixStyleSpecBuilder`, the builder every Remix component already uses to accept either a fluent style or a resolved `styleSpec`. Packages that compose Remix into their own surfaces previously had to reimplement that either/or, and the copies dropped the `controller` and focus-highlight plumbing that makes state variants resolve.

## 1.0.0-beta.9

- Export the Naked UI constructor and state types required by generated
  application-owned Accordion, Disclosure, Slider, and Tabs recipes.
 - **FIX**(data_list): bound minimum intrinsic width by maximum (#185).

## 1.0.0-beta.8

 - **FEAT**(sidebar): publish a Remix sidebar panel (#168).

## 1.0.0-beta.7

 - **REFACTOR**(remix): simplify composite surface rendering (#165).
 - **FEAT**(remix): give the two effect Mixes their dot-shorthand pair (#169).
 - **FEAT**(remix): add RemixMenuTrigger.builder for custom menu triggers (#166).
 - **FEAT**(remix): add disclosure component (#164).

## 1.0.0-beta.6

 - **FIX**: correct dashboard showcase and checkbox indicator regressions (#162).

## 1.0.0-beta.5

> Note: This release has breaking changes.

 - **FEAT**(remix): add styler field metadata, raise Mix floor to 2.2.0-beta.5 (#158).
 - **BREAKING** **REFACTOR**(remix): make interactive components visual-only over naked_ui (#157).
 - **BREAKING** **REFACTOR**(remix): generate callable component stylers (#152).
 - **BREAKING** **FEAT**(remix): add RemixLink and rebuild FortalLink on it (#151).

## 1.0.0-beta.4

- **BREAKING**: `RemixIconButton.semanticLabel` is required and must be
  nonblank. The generic `Icon Button` accessible name is removed.
- **BREAKING**: `RemixRadio.semanticLabel` and `RemixSwitch.semanticLabel`
  are required and must be nonblank. Adjacent `Text` is not an accessible
  name.
- **BREAKING**: `RemixSelect` with `onChanged == null` is a genuinely
  disabled control. A callback-less select no longer opens for inspection.
- **BREAKING**: `RemixSlider` requires `min < max` and
  `snapDivisions == null || snapDivisions > 0`.
- **BREAKING**: `showRemixDialog` requires a nonblank `barrierLabel` when
  `barrierDismissible` is true. `RemixDialog` requires `semanticLabel` or
  `title` when it owns the dialog role; a caller-owned ancestor dialog may
  provide the role and accessible name instead.
- **BREAKING**: `RemixTextField.readOnly` no longer resolves as
  `WidgetState.disabled`. A read-only field is styled as enabled, so themes
  that relied on the disabled visual for read-only need a dedicated recipe.
- **BREAKING**: `RemixButton` and `RemixIconButton` no longer mark the
  control as a semantic live region while `loading` is true. Entering the
  loading state is no longer announced; `naked_ui` has no replacement API
  yet.
- **FIX**: Compose `RemixTabBar` inside `NakedTabBar` so the tab list owns
  tab-bar semantics and keyboard traversal.
- **FIX**: `NakedButton` is the sole semantic and behavior owner for
  `RemixButton` and `RemixIconButton`. Visual content no longer republishes
  the accessible name.
- **FIX**: `RemixSelect` forwards the public `onChanged`, announces
  `semanticLabel ?? label`, and resolves option styles from
  `NakedSelectOptionState.controllerOf`. Each option row resolves only the
  item branch of the style, so per-item animation and widget modifiers
  render and the root modifiers are not re-applied per row.
- **FIX**: `RemixSlider` paints the range from Naked direction-aware visual
  percentages.
- **FIX**: `RemixSlider` centers the thumb on the track when the track is
  thicker than the thumb. The thumb previously ignored the horizontal inset
  the track takes from its padding, so it sat
  `trackThickness / 2 - thumbWidth / 2` short of the track at every value.
- **FIX**: `RemixRadio` uses `NakedRadioState.isSelected` and forwards
  grouping to `NakedRadioGroup`.
- **BREAKING**: Replace handwritten component `Styler.call(...)` extensions
  with generator-owned instance methods. Ordinary `.call(...)` and callable
  styler syntax remain source-compatible, but explicit references to the old
  `Remix*StylerRemixHelpers` call extensions are removed.
- **FEAT**: Add a generated callable widget surface to `DataTableStyler`.
- **BREAKING**: `RemixSelectTrigger` gains `collapsedIcon` and `expandedIcon`,
  replacing the hardcoded trigger chevron. Each state falls back independently,
  so a trigger that only sets one keeps the default for the other.
- **FEAT**: Forward semantic and behavioral parameters that the underlying Naked
  primitives already supported. `RemixRadio` and `RemixMenu` gain
  `semanticLabel` and `excludeSemantics`, `RemixSwitch` gains
  `excludeSemantics`, and the matching `Styler.call(...)` helpers accept the
  same values, closing eight audited gaps.
- **FIX**: Add `mouseCursor` to `RemixSelect` and `SelectStyler.call`, defaulting
  to `SystemMouseCursors.click` and forwarding it to `NakedSelect`, so a
  disabled trigger keeps the basic cursor.

## 1.0.0-beta.3

- **BREAKING**: Remove handwritten component styler aliases that duplicate the
  generated API. Use `color` for component surfaces; explicit child-slot
  methods such as `labelColor`, `iconColor`, `textColor`, and `contentTextStyle`
  for component parts; `size(width, height)` for square and fixed sizes; and
  `wrap(.rotate(...))` for whole-widget rotation.
- **BREAKING**: Remove `RemixBoxStylerConvenience` and its shorthand methods.
  Use the canonical compound forms such as `padding(.all(value))`,
  `margin(.horizontal(value))`, `border(.color(value))`,
  `borderRadius(.circular(value))`, and `transform(Matrix4.identity())`.
- **BREAKING**: Remove direct Material usage from the published packages.
  `remix` no longer imports `package:flutter/material.dart`, ships no Material
  default icons, and sets `uses-material-design: false`. Hosts on `WidgetsApp`
  or `CupertinoApp` no longer pull Material in through Remix.
- **FEAT**: Give `RemixAccordion` a panel container that owns the item's
  border, radius, fill, and clipping, removing the notched seam between an
  expanded trigger and its content. `AccordionSpec` gains `container` and
  `containerEffects`; `trigger` remains the forwarded part.
- **FIX**: Correct focus-visible state handling.
- **FIX**: Respect input modality when showing focus rings, so a pointer
  interaction no longer leaves a keyboard focus ring behind.
- **FIX**: Make checkbox styles value-comparable.
- **FIX**: Forward `excludeSemantics` on toggle.
- Raise the `naked_ui` floor to `^1.0.0-beta.10`, which adds
  `NakedAccordion.itemBuilder` and tracks accordion press state whenever the
  item is enabled rather than only when a callback is supplied.

## 1.0.0-beta.2

- **FEAT**: Lower the supported floor to Dart 3.11 / Flutter 3.41, matching
  `mix` and `naked_ui`, so the whole family installs together. Only one call
  required a newer SDK — `SizeTransition.alignment` in the default accordion
  transition — and it was replaced with the equivalent `axisAlignment`, which
  renders the identical alignment.
- **BREAKING**: Fortal (`FortalScope`, `Fortal*` widgets, `fortal*Style()`
  recipes, `FortalTokens`, and the Radix color swatches) moved to the new
  [`remix_fortal`](https://pub.dev/packages/remix_fortal) package. `remix` no
  longer exports any Fortal symbol and ships no theme. To keep using Fortal, add
  `remix_fortal` and import `package:remix_fortal/remix_fortal.dart` alongside
  `package:remix/remix.dart`.
- **FIX**: Center `RemixSegmentedControl` segment content along the main axis,
  matching the Radix segmented control item anatomy. Equal segments make most
  surfaces wider than their content, which previously start-aligned the
  icon/label cluster. An explicit item container `alignment` still overrides
  the centered default.
- **FEAT**: Add `RemixSegmentedControl`, an equal-segment single-select control
  mapped from Radix Segmented Control. A custom render object sizes every
  segment to the largest one and divides an explicit track extent equally,
  reporting intrinsics that stay consistent with layout so intrinsic-sizing
  parents wrap labels instead of overflowing. Selection is controlled and
  never cleared by reactivating the selected segment; `T extends Object` keeps
  `null` reserved as the no-selection sentinel and `onChanged` non-null.
  Roving keyboard focus, `Home`/`End`, optional looping, RTL-aware arrow
  navigation, per-item disabled state, and vertical orientation are supported,
  and each segment exposes one merged selected-button semantics node. No
  Fortal preset ships in v1, so callers own the visual layer.
- **FEAT**: Add `RemixTextArea`, a constructor-only multiline facade over
  `RemixTextField` with two-line auto-growing defaults and the canonical
  `TextFieldStyler` / `TextFieldSpec` styling surface.
- **BREAKING**: Change `TextFieldSpec.container` and
  `TextFieldStyler.container` from `FlexBoxSpec` / `FlexBoxStyler` to
  `BoxSpec` / `BoxStyler` because TextField and TextArea always render their
  input anatomy as a fixed horizontal row. The full forwarded Box surface is
  honored, generated `spacing` and `crossAxisAlignment` methods control the row
  directly, and the row follows the ambient text direction. Misleading Flex
  direction, main-axis, vertical-direction, text-direction, text-baseline, and
  `flex(FlexStyler)` container methods are no longer exposed.
- **FIX**: Render the separate label/input/helper `layout` as a real `FlexBox`
  so its full generated Flex direction surface is truthful. The base style
  preserves the existing vertical, min-size, start-aligned layout with 8px
  spacing, while explicit row layouts are now honored without a forced-column
  assertion.
- **FIX**: Remove the unreleased `RemixTextArea.styleFrom` affordance because
  the shared `TextFieldStyler` callable constructs a single-line
  `RemixTextField`. Pass a `TextFieldStyler` to `RemixTextArea.style` instead.
- **FIX**: Top-align multiline TextField hints and expose label, hint, helper,
  error, and interactive accessory semantics once. The composite gesture tap
  target is unchanged, but the field's semantic bounds now cover the editable
  area rather than the full container box; restoring full-box assistive-tech
  bounds needs an upstream naked_ui hook and is tracked there.
- **FIX**: Clear TextField hovered styling when the field is disabled while a
  pointer is over it. The hover region unmounts without an exit event, so the
  state previously leaked across a disable/re-enable cycle.
- **FEAT**: Add an optional styled `RemixCheckbox.label` inside the checkbox's
  pointer, focus, and single semantics target, with a 48-by-48 default minimum
  target and an explicit `Size.zero` compact opt-out. Mix now generates the
  label, label-spacing, interpolation, equality, and fluent label APIs, and
  generated Fortal checkbox wrappers forward the new widget parameters.
- **FEAT**: Add `RemixCheckboxGroup<T extends Object>` and
  `RemixCheckboxGroupItem<T extends Object>`, a controlled, layout-transparent
  coordinator for a typed `Set<T>` of checkbox options. The group owns selected
  values plus group-wide enabled/required semantics; items compose
  `RemixCheckbox`, require a visible `label`, accept `semanticLabel` as an
  accessible-name override, and forward `minimumTapTargetSize`, so existing
  `CheckboxStyler`/`fortalCheckboxStyle()` recipes apply unchanged while the
  entire labeled 48px target stays interactive. Emits a new unmodifiable set
  per change and renders a labeled semantics container with explicit checkbox
  children. Debug builds validate duplicate values, duplicate autofocus, and
  blank accessible names, and require a nonblank group `semanticLabel`
  whenever `isRequired` is true and semantics are not excluded.
- **BREAKING** **FEAT**: Add checkbox items, radio groups, and submenus to the
  sealed `RemixMenuItemData` hierarchy. Downstream exhaustive switches must
  handle the new cases or add a wildcard; no runtime migration is required.
- **FEAT**: Support reusable menu-wide customization by passing
  `fortalMenuStyle(...).merge(customStyle)` to `RemixMenu.style`; generated
  `FortalMenu` constructors remain recipe-only.
- **FEAT**: Add `RemixDataList`, a semantic label/value list mapped from
  Radix DataList. Horizontal orientation shares one negotiated label column
  across every row, supports intrinsic-width parents, and lets string values
  wrap unbroken identifiers at grapheme-safe boundaries while custom value
  widgets retain their intrinsic sizing; vertical orientation stacks label
  above value. Rows expose one `list`/`listItem` semantics pair with full-row
  bounds, interactive custom values stay actionable, `semanticValue` opts a
  display-only child into a summarized announcement, and
  `RemixDataListItem.key` gives rows stable identity across reorder, insertion,
  and removal.
- **FEAT**: Add the Remix rendering subsystem for layered inset and outer
  shadows, gradients, outlines, backdrop blur, blend modes, and ordered color
  filters used by the Radix-accurate Fortal recipes.
- **FEAT**: Expose the complete Fortal theme surface through `FortalScope`,
  including accent and gray palettes, brightness, panel backgrounds, radius,
  scaling, optional background painting, and modifier ordering.
- **FEAT**: Expose `ButtonStyler` as the canonical button styling API.
  `RemixButtonStyler` remains available as a deprecated compatibility alias.
- **FEAT**: Unprefixed styling names are now canonical for every component.
  `RemixXStyler` becomes `XStyler` and `RemixXSpec` becomes `XSpec` across
  Accordion, Avatar, Badge, Callout, Card, Checkbox, Dialog, Divider,
  IconButton, Menu, Popover, Progress, Radio, Select, Slider, Spinner, Switch,
  Tabs, TextField, Toggle, ToggleGroup, and Tooltip. Every `RemixXStyler` name
  remains as a deprecated source-compatible alias exported from
  `package:remix/remix.dart`, and every `RemixXSpec` name remains as a typedef
  beside its canonical spec, so existing code keeps compiling. Widgets, data
  classes, and rendering primitives keep the `Remix` prefix — for example
  `RemixButton`, `RemixMenu`, `RemixMenuItem`, `RemixBoxEffectsSpec`, and
  `RemixBoxStylerMixin` are unchanged. Public styler extension names such as
  `RemixCardStylerRemixHelpers` are also unchanged, so explicit extension
  invocation stays source-compatible.
- **BREAKING**: Rename Fortal recipe helpers from `fortalXStyler()` to
  `fortalXStyle()` so `@MixWidget` can infer every generated `FortalX` name.
  Remix component styler types such as `ButtonStyler` and
  `AvatarStyler` are unchanged.
- **FEAT**: Expose every Fortal recipe parameter on its generated widget,
  including `highContrast` and Avatar's `fallbackLength`, while retaining both
  the unnamed `variant:` constructor and generated named variant constructors.
- **FEAT**: Add `RemixSkeleton`, a decorative loading placeholder that keeps a
  child mounted for its geometry and local state while suppressing that child's
  paint, pointer input, keyboard focus, semantics, and tickers. The pulse
  interpolates the container fill between `color` and `pulseColor`, falls back
  to a composed whole-surface opacity fade whenever a gradient, image, or
  foreground decoration would mask that fill, and honours
  `MediaQuery.disableAnimationsOf` initially and on runtime changes.
- **FIX**: Allow `naked_ui` releases compatible with `^1.0.0-beta.8` so open
  labelled tooltips retain one interactive semantics node without hiding
  unlabelled overlay semantics.
- **FIX**: Keep dialog titles and actions fixed while structured descriptions
  and body content scroll within bounded dialogs.
- **FIX**: Resolve Fortal Avatar icon geometry through scaled design tokens for
  both the default icon and custom icon-builder paths.
- **FIX**: Keep Remix icon-button semantics on one interactive node across
  normal, loading, and excluded-semantics states.
- **FIX**: Support 200 percent text scaling in Fortal buttons and toggles
  without clipping labels or changing normal-scale geometry.
- **FIX**: Render `FortalSpinner` and Fortal button loading states with the
  eight fading Radix leaves while preserving the arc painter for plain
  `RemixSpinner`.

## 1.0.0-beta.1

- **BREAKING** **FIX**: `RemixDialog.child` now composes with `title`,
  `description`, and `actions` in `AlertDialog` order instead of silently
  discarding them. A lone `child` still fills the container directly, so fully
  custom dialog bodies are unaffected.

- **BREAKING**: Rename fluent style builders from `RemixXStyle` to `RemixXStyler` and Fortal helpers from `fortalXStyle()` to `fortalXStyler()`, matching Mix terminology (`BoxStyler`, `TextStyler`, `MixStyler`). Widget parameter stays `style:`. No deprecated aliases were kept for the removed `RemixXStyle` names.
- **BREAKING**: Public `styleSpec` is raw `RemixXSpec?` on all component surfaces (resolved via `RemixStyleSpecBuilder`); StyleWidget-based components converted to explicit widgets.
- **BREAKING**: `RemixSelect` overlay placement is `positioning: OverlayPositionConfig` (removed public `targetAnchor`/`followerAnchor`).
- **BREAKING**: Remove `enableFeedback` from `RemixRadio` (not exposed by `NakedRadio`).
- **BREAKING**: `RemixButtonStyler` unnamed constructor now takes unresolved stylers (`FlexBoxStyler`, `TextStyler`, `IconStyler`, `RemixSpinnerStyler`) instead of resolved `StyleSpec` values, matching sibling components.
- **BREAKING**: Rename `text` to `label` on `RemixAvatarSpec`/`RemixAvatarStyler` and `RemixBadgeSpec`/`RemixBadgeStyler` (fields, constructor params, and generated setters).
- **BREAKING**: Remove `RemixAvatarStyler.iconColor`/`.textColor` and `RemixCalloutStyler.iconColor`/`.textColor` factory constructors; use the `iconColor()`/`labelColor()`/`textColor()` instance methods instead.
- **BREAKING**: Rename `RemixSlider.enableHapticFeedback` to `enableFeedback`, matching the other interactive components.
- **BREAKING**: `onChanged` is now optional/nullable on `RemixSlider`, `RemixSwitch`, `RemixToggle`, and `RemixRadioGroup`; omitting it (or passing null) disables the control.
- **BREAKING**: `RemixButton.onPressed` and `RemixIconButton.onPressed` are no longer `required`; omitting them renders a disabled button.
- **BREAKING**: Remove the nonfunctional `RemixDialogStyler.overlay`, `RemixTextFieldStyler.cursorOffset`, and raw `RemixTextFieldSpec.spacing` APIs. Dialog barriers remain configured through `showRemixDialog(barrierColor:)`; Naked UI does not expose a cursor-offset override. The existing `RemixTextFieldStyler.spacing()` convenience still configures the input row.
- **BREAKING**: `package:remix/remix.dart` no longer exports `src/theme/remix_theme.dart` (`resolveRemixBrightness`/`resolveRemixBrightnessValues` were test-only helpers).
- **BREAKING**: Bump `mix` to ^2.1.0, `mix_annotations`/`mix_generator` to hosted `^2.1.2`, and `naked_ui` to `^1.0.0-beta.3` (stable 1.0 pub tag blocked until `naked_ui` is stable).
- **FIX**: Consume `naked_ui` beta.3's type-specific state scopes, including typed menu-item and select-option controllers, while preserving callback-optional `RemixSelect` browsing.
- **FIX**: Forward menu interception, outside-tap, root-overlay, close-on-outside-click, focus, and positioning options through `RemixMenuStyler.call()` and generated `FortalMenu` widgets.
- **FEAT**: Add `call()` widget-builder methods to all component stylers and reproducibly generate every `FortalX` convenience widget via `@MixWidget`, including generic Radio/Accordion/Menu/Select surfaces.
- **FEAT**: Add generated named constructors for Fortal variants (for example, `FortalButton.solid(...)`); Dart infers generic types for calls such as `FortalRadio.soft(...)`, and the unnamed constructors remain available.
- **FEAT**: Fortal wrappers for dialog, menu, select, tooltip, and tabs parts (`FortalTabBar`/`FortalTab`/`FortalTabView`).
- **FEAT**: Tooltip `dismissDuration` (hover-exit → `NakedTooltip.dismissDelay`); `showDuration` remains touch wait → `touchDelay`.
- **FEAT**: Add `positioning` (`OverlayPositionConfig`) to `RemixTooltip` and `enabled` to `RemixIconButton`.
- **FEAT**: Add `FortalAccordionVariant`/`FortalAccordionSize` parameters to `fortalAccordionStyler()`.
- **FIX**: Menu trigger renders icon before label.
- **FIX**: Fortal TextField disabled surface/soft use background-fill tokens (no debug `Colors.red`).
- **FIX**: `RemixMenuStyler.item(...)` default item styling is now applied to menu items (per-item styles override it); previously it was silently ignored.
- **FIX**: Forward TextField alignment, cursor, selection, scroll-padding, keyboard-appearance, outside-tap, pointer, and semantics values to `NakedTextField` while preserving widget-state variants.
- **FIX**: `showRemixDialog` works with or without a `MixScope`, and scoped dialog builders now receive a context below the cloned scope.
- **FIX**: Preserve nested spinner and divider animation/modifier metadata instead of dropping the enclosing `StyleSpec`.
- **FIX**: Apply `RemixButtonStyler.iconAlignment` to a single icon while preserving explicit leading/trailing positions when both are present.
- **FIX**: Apply `RemixTooltipStyler.label` to text descendants of custom tooltip content.
- **FEAT**: `FortalSelect` now includes its matching default item style, while per-item styles remain optional overrides.
- **FEAT**: `RemixIconButtonStyler.call()` and generated `FortalIconButton` widgets now forward the complete widget behavior surface.
