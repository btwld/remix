/// Every styler one [AgentComposer] needs, in one value.
///
/// `AgentComposer` takes five stylers: its own anatomy through `style`, and
/// four unresolved child stylers for the card, the text area, and the send and
/// stop buttons. A single `@MixWidget` recipe cannot supply the other four,
/// because `AgentComposerSpec` holds only the toolbar. So the application
/// hands over a bundle instead, and the call site spreads it across the
/// parameters the widget already has.
///
/// The child stylers stay **unresolved** on purpose. Resolving a nested
/// `IconButtonSpec` here would freeze the button at one state and lose its own
/// hover, press, focus, and disabled fragments; `RemixIconButton` resolves
/// them against its own controller.

/// It adds application geometry — 48px action targets, toolbar, card inset,
/// and the field's missing second box — and takes everything else from the
/// installed [uiCardStyle], [uiTextAreaStyle], and [uiIconButtonStyle]
/// recipes in `lib/ui/components/`. Editing one of those files changes this
/// composer with it, which is the whole point of installing them.
///
/// It is the one demo wired this way. The other seven surfaces still use the
/// local structural stylers in `demos.dart`; their buttons reuse installed
/// recipes. The package's ADR records this intermediate state: prove one
/// complete surface before converting eight.
///
/// Each parameter is merged **last** into its own styler, so a call site can
/// override any one surface without forking the bundle:

/// final recipe = uiAgentComposerRecipe(
///   submitStyle: IconButtonStyler().color(const Color(0xFF7C3AED)),
