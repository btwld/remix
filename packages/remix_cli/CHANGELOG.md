## Unreleased

- **Breaking.** `remix.yaml` schema 3 is the only readable configuration.
  Schemas 1 and 2 named no registry and read from a catalog frozen inside the
  CLI; both that catalog and `remix registry migrate` are gone. A project still
  on an earlier schema deletes `remix.yaml` and runs `remix init` to pin a
  registry; installed source and generated adapters are untouched. The registry
  index (schema 1) and catalog (schema 2) formats are unchanged.
- Item names are qualified with their registry namespace in every `add`,
  `--dry-run` and `--diff` report, since every project now names its sources.

- Generate `theme`, `darkTheme`, and `mode` scope parameters for both presets, including light/dark defaults and live system appearance. **Breaking:** remove the default scope `data` parameter; use `theme`.
- Restructure the internal registry source layer behind one `RegistrySources`
  seam and a `RegistryReader` port. No `remix.yaml`, registry index, or catalog
  schema change from this restructuring; `lib/src` is not a supported
  programmatic API. See `open_code/REGISTRY_PORT.md`.
- Document registries, pinning, and publishing your own registry at
  `docs/guides/registries.mdx`.

- Name the active starter preset `vanilla` and select it by default.

- Publish catalogs independently under `registry/` with a versioned preset
  index and schema-2 namespaced dependencies.
- Initialize schema-3 projects from stable GitHub registry releases, pinned to
  full commits. Add explicit registry registration and pin updates.
- Resolve cross-registry dependency graphs before writes; reject cycles,
  conflicting targets and incompatible package requirements while preserving
  application-owned source and installed generated adapters.
- Diff and overwrite remain explicit source-review actions.

## 0.1.0

- `remix add` accepts several items in one invocation, as in
  `remix add button card dialog`. The batch resolves to a single ordered
  install, so a shared dependency is written once and the dependency
  resolution, formatting, code generation, and analysis steps each run once
  for the whole batch instead of once per item. `--overwrite` applies to every
  requested item and still never to a dependency pulled in behind one. An
  unknown or repeated item fails before any write. Single-item invocations are
  unchanged.

- Adds `sidebar_layout` to both presets: an open-code shell layout, not a
  styled component, that rows an installed `sidebar` beside a header and body
  above its compact breakpoint, and presents it as a start-edge sheet below
  it. It has no `Spec` and installs no generated adapter.

- `sidebar` in both presets labels collapsed icon-rail destinations with the
  application's `tooltip` recipe, so adding it also installs `tooltip`. The
  Fortal recipe also narrows its navigation padding as the rail collapses.
- Adds a `toast` item to both presets. Its action and close control are the
  application's own `button` and `icon_button` recipes, so adding it installs
  both. It needs the Remix release that ships `RemixToastScope`.

- Require Remix `^1.0.0-beta.10` for the generated adapters and `mix_chart`
  `^0.0.1-beta.3` for the optional chart recipe. CI checks
  both presets with checkout Remix. Publication requires the hosted check.

- Adds the `fortal` preset as application-owned source derived from the
  repository's analyzed Radix Themes 3.3.0 implementation. It installs a
  prefixed 277-token theme and full component catalog without a
  `remix_fortal`, direct `mix`, or direct `naked_ui` dependency.
- Adds a preset axis to `remix init`. New configurations use schema 2 and
  record `preset: default`; schema 1 configurations remain compatible and
  read as the default preset.
- Initial project-local CLI for installing editable Remix UI source.
- Uses the Flutter SDK and its Dart executable on Windows. CI verifies installation with the real SDK.
- Supports explicit, glob, and nested workspace members through Pub's resolved package configuration.
- Rejects reserved runtime prefixes before writing source and prints command help once.
- Preserves spaces and special characters in generation filters. Each filter selects one generated file.
- Bundles theme plus a registry item for every styled component surface in
  `remix`: accordion, avatar, badge, button, callout, card,
  checkbox, data_list,
  data_table, dialog, disclosure, divider, icon_button, link, menu, popover,
  progress, radio, segmented_control, select, skeleton, slider,
  spinner, switch, tabs, textfield, toggle, toggle_group, and tooltip.
- Add a default `sidebar` recipe backed by `RemixSidebar` in beta.8.
  Destinations use the application's `toggle` recipe.
- Adds an opt-in `icons` seam backed by `remix_ui_icons` for application-owned
  glyph aliases.
- Adds an optional `chart` item backed directly by `mix_chart`. One editable
  recipe generates line, bar, and pie adapters without depending on Fortal.
  Its palette reads the default theme's `chart1` to `chart5` tokens, which
  clear 4.5:1 against the page in both shipped themes.
- Keeps already-installed registry adapters in a focused generation run so a
  new dependency cannot invalidate build_runner's graph and remove them.
- Every item depends on `theme`. `data_table` also depends on `checkbox`,
  `icon_button`, and `select`, because its selection column, pager, and
  page-size control are those components; `add data_table` installs all four.
  `sidebar` also depends on `toggle`, because a destination is one; `add
  sidebar` installs both.
- `add` reports when the resolved `remix` is newer than the version this
  registry snapshot was authored against. The install still completes;
  `--dry-run` and `--diff` never print it, because they stop before
  `flutter pub get`.
