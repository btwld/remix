# Presets: Fortal as application-owned source

**Status:** Implemented; publication pending
**Base branch:** `feat/open-code`

## The problem

`remix_cli` installs one registry: a 20-token `theme` item and one authored
recipe per component. Fortal is a second, complete design language on Remix,
with 277 tokens, Radix color data, 35 recipes, and a parity contract against
Radix Themes 3.3.0. Today an application can adopt Fortal only as a hosted
package. It cannot own the source the way it owns the default recipes.

This document designs the change that lets an application run
`remix init --preset fortal` and then `remix add button`, and receive editable
Fortal source under its own prefix. The final PR stack is Open Code, then Fortal, then the existing Sidebar PR.
The Fortal PR preserves the five implementation commits described below.

## Decisions

These were reached in review before this document. Each one is stated once,
with the reason, so a reviewer does not reopen it by accident.

1. **A preset is a registry tree, chosen once at `init`.** A Fortal button
   resolves Fortal tokens and a default button resolves default tokens, so the
   two cannot mix in one application. The choice is recorded in `remix.yaml`,
   next to the prefix, and follows the same rule as the prefix: it cannot
   change after `init`. This is also how shadcn treats `style` in
   `components.json`.
2. **One recipe tree per preset.** shadcn v4 shares one component source across
   styles because every style uses one variant vocabulary. Fortal's vocabulary
   (`classic`, `solid`, `soft`, `surface`, `outline`, `ghost`) is not the
   default's (`primary`, `secondary`, `outline`, `ghost`, `destructive`), so
   a shared recipe with swappable data is not possible between these two.
3. **Fortal is authored once, as Dart, in `registry_source/lib/src/fortal`.** The
   `remix_cli` templates are derived from that source and committed. A check
   fails when they drift. The alternative, hand-authored `.tmpl` files, means
   editing 36 files without an analyzer, and running the 50 test files and
   the parity checker through a temporary-app render on every change. shadcn
   moved from hand-authored per-style trees to authored source plus a build
   for the same reason.
4. **The Radix color table installs as source.** It is one generated file
   pinned to Radix Themes 3.3.0 that regenerates only on a reviewed pin move.
   A package for data that never changes buys nothing, and the pub.dev name
   `radix_colors` is already taken. Installing it lets an application add a
   custom 12-step scale, which the closed accent enum forbids today.
5. **Nothing installed is named Fortal.** The word appears in the registry
   directory name and in `remix.yaml`. The application gets `AcmeScope`,
   `AcmeTokens`, `AcmeButton`, and token ids such as `acme.accent.9`.
6. **`mix_chart` stays a hosted dependency of the `chart` item.** It is the
   chart engine the recipe styles, as `remix` is the button engine. The
   default `chart` item already declares it.
7. **`remix_fortal` leaves pub.dev; its source lives in `registry_source/fortal`.**
   Hosted Fortal has no consumer base to protect: 0 likes and 438 downloads at
   `1.0.0-beta.7`. pub.dev cannot delete a package, so the package is marked
   discontinued with `remix init --preset fortal` named as the replacement. The
   source is not deleted: it is what the templates derive from, the target of
   the parity checker and its test suite. It is a private workspace package
   with no version, `registry_source`, holding the default and Agent sources
   beside it, and no application depends on it — they install. The
   source and template check detects byte drift: `--check` fails CI on any byte
   of difference, the same way `docs/fortal/catalog.mdx` and the dogfood
   consumers are checked today. See
   `registry_source/docs/adr/fortal/0002-registry-source.md`.

## What the application gets

```shell
dart run remix_cli:remix init --prefix Acme --preset fortal
dart run remix_cli:remix add button
```

```text
lib/ui/
  ui.dart
  theme/
    theme.dart             barrel of the files below, minus radix_colors; exported from ui.dart
    radix_colors.dart      generated Radix 3.3.0 scales; not exported from ui.dart
    computed.dart          role math, shadows, token resolution
    control_styles.dart    shared focus and inset-surface helpers
    tokens.dart            AcmeTokens
    theme_data.dart        AcmeThemeConfig, AcmeThemeData, the token map
    theme_scope.dart       AcmeScope, AcmeTheme
    surface_frame.dart
  components/
    base_button.dart       shared Button and IconButton metrics and states
    button.dart            authored; edit this
    button.g.dart          generated; AcmeButton, AcmeButton.solid, ...
```

Hosted dependencies after install: `remix` and `mix_annotations`, with
`build_runner` and `mix_generator` for generation. `remix_ui_icons` arrives
only with `icons`. `mix_chart` arrives only with `chart`. No Fortal package.

The application then edits the same three places the default preset offers:
theme values in `theme_data.dart`, a recipe in `components/`, and a per-widget
`style` argument that merges last.

## The registry after this stack

```text
packages/remix_cli/lib/src/registry/
  default/
    registry.yaml                 moved, unchanged
    templates/<item>/...          moved, unchanged
  fortal/
    registry.yaml                 derived
    templates/theme/*.dart.tmpl   derived
    templates/<item>/<item>.dart.tmpl
```

`remix.yaml` gains one key at schema 2:

```yaml
schema: 2
prefix: Acme
preset: fortal
paths:
  ui: lib/ui
```

A schema 1 file has no `preset` key and reads as `preset: default`, so
`apps/playground/remix.yaml` and every existing consumer keep working.

## The Fortal source after this stack

The package layout mirrors the installed layout. This is a hard requirement,
not a nicety: derivation replaces every `Fortal` and `fortal` in a file, so a
relative import such as `'../fortal/fortal.dart'` would break. After the move,
no path segment under `lib/src` contains the word.

| Today | After |
|---|---|
| `src/fortal/fortal_theme.dart` (2217 lines) | `src/theme/tokens.dart`, `src/theme/theme_data.dart`, `src/theme/theme_scope.dart`, `src/theme/control_styles.dart` |
| `src/fortal/computed.dart` | `src/theme/computed.dart` |
| `src/fortal/surface_frame.dart` | `src/theme/surface_frame.dart` |
| `src/radix/colors/colors.dart` + `colors_generated.dart` | `src/theme/radix_colors.dart`, one file, written by `scripts/generate_radix_colors.dart` |
| `src/fortal/base_button_recipe.dart` + `base_button_state_styles.dart` | `src/components/base_button.dart` |
| `src/recipes/typography_shared.dart` | `src/components/typography.dart` |
| `src/recipes/<name>.dart` | `src/components/<name>.dart` |
| `src/radix/icons.dart` | `src/icons.dart` |
| `src/fortal/fortal.dart` (internal barrel) | `src/theme/theme.dart`; exports every theme file except `radix_colors.dart` |

The internal barrel survives on purpose. All 36 files under `recipes/`
import it today, so the move is one path change per file instead of a
36-file audit of which theme file each one uses. No recipe references a Radix color type, so the barrel
does not export `radix_colors.dart`; `computed.dart` and `theme_data.dart`
import that file directly.

The public barrel `lib/remix_fortal.dart` keeps every export, so the public
API does not change. `test/public_api_test.dart` proves it. Remix's own public
barrel also re-exports the six Naked constructor/state types referenced by
generated adapters, keeping installed recipes on the `package:remix/remix.dart`
boundary.

## Derivation

`tool/build_registry.dart` at the workspace root, next to
`check_open_code.dart`, does the following.

**Input.** Every `.dart` file under `registry_source/fortal/lib/src` except
`*.g.dart`. The application generates its own parts.

**Refusals, checked first.** Any path segment containing `fortal`. Any file
containing `{{`, because the renderer treats that as a template token. Any
`package:remix_fortal`, `package:mix`, or `package:naked_ui` import, because
installed source must import the public `remix` surface. Each refusal names
the file.

**Substitution.** Plain `replaceAll` of `Fortal` with `{{typePrefix}}` and
`fortal` with `{{valuePrefix}}`. This is the exact inverse of
`TemplateRenderer.render`, so rendering with `Fortal` and `fortal` reproduces
the source byte for byte. That round trip is the drift test. Token id strings
follow the same rule and become `acme.accent.9` in the application. `Radix*`
identifiers do not contain the word and pass through.

**Placement.** `theme/*.dart` goes to `templates/theme/`. `components/x.dart`
goes to `templates/x/x.dart.tmpl`. `icons.dart` is skipped: no Fortal recipe
references an icon, and an icon alias set is not part of a design language,
so the Fortal `icons` item is a copy of the default `icons` template. Both
presets install the same file.

**Registry.** The tool also writes `registry/fortal/registry.yaml`, so the
item graph is correct by construction:

- `registryDependencies` come from relative imports. Any `'../theme/...'`
  import means `theme`, so the theme item is one node no matter which theme
  file a recipe names. A sibling import such as `'checkbox.dart'` means
  `checkbox`. Today those sibling imports are exactly: `data_table` to
  `checkbox`, `icon_button`, and `select` (and transitively `base_button`
  through `icon_button`); `sidebar` to `text` and `toggle`;
  `text`, `code`, `heading`, `kbd`, and `link` to `typography`; `button` and
  `icon_button` to `base_button`.
- `generated` is present when the file has a `part 'x.g.dart';` line.
- `dependencies` and `devDependencies` follow three rules, with every
  constraint read from the default registry so the version floors live in
  one place. `theme` declares `remix`. An item with a generated part declares
  `mix_annotations`, `build_runner`, and `mix_generator`, as the default
  `button` does. An item that imports `package:mix_chart` or
  `package:remix_ui_icons` declares that package too. `base_button` and
  `typography` have no part and no `@MixWidget`, so they declare nothing.
- `exports` lists `theme/theme.dart` for the theme item and the recipe file
  for every other item. `theme/radix_colors.dart` is never exported: it
  declares bare top-level names such as `gray` and `red` that must not enter
  `ui.dart`. `theme/computed.dart` is exported through the barrel; its names
  are prefixed, and `chart.dart` calls `resolveFortalTokens` from it.

**Modes.** No flag writes. `--check` derives in memory, compares with the
committed files, and fails on any difference. `melos run open-code:fortal:check`
runs it in CI, the way `docs:check` runs `generate_fortal_catalog.dart`.

## The PR stack

1. `feat/open-code` targets `main` in PR #177.
2. `feat/fortal-presets` targets `feat/open-code` in PR #180.
3. `feat/open-code-sidebar` targets `feat/fortal-presets` in PR #178.

GitHub tracks these PRs as a native stack. Follow the merge and publication
steps in [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md).
The original plan proposed five Fortal PRs. The final stack keeps those
implementation boundaries as five commits in one Fortal PR.
The Sidebar PR remains separate because it adds a default recipe.

## Implementation commits

The first two commits prepare Fortal source. The third adds preset selection.
The fourth adds the derived preset and its consumer fixture. The fifth removes
Fortal publication from repository automation. Package discontinuation remains
a later release action.

Two earlier drafts were folded in. The fresh-app proof is part of the PR
that ships the Fortal preset, because a preset without its proof is not
done. Docs land with the PR they describe, because `validate_docs.dart`
already checks them and a flag without docs is not done either.

### Commit 1: `refactor(remix_fortal)`: lay the source out like an installed preset

A pure move. Git sees renames, reviewers see paths, and no behavior changes.
This goes first so every later content diff lands on the final paths.

- Apply the file table above. Split `fortal_theme.dart` into three files:
  the `FortalTokens` class; the token-map builder with `FortalThemeConfig`
  and `FortalThemeData`; and `FortalScope` with `FortalTheme`. The
  declarations are not contiguous today, `FortalScope` sits between the
  builder and the data classes, so this is an extraction by declaration, not
  a slice by line range. Dart does not care about declaration order.
- Merge the color pair into `theme/radix_colors.dart`. Point
  `scripts/generate_radix_colors.dart` at the new path. Keep the file header
  and the integrity hash.
- Rename the internal barrel to `theme/theme.dart` and repoint every one of
  the 36 files under `recipes/` that import it. Drop `radix_colors.dart` from
  its exports.
- `tool/generate_fortal_catalog.dart` hardcodes `lib/src/recipes/<name>.dart`
  in `_recipePath` and opens those files to render `docs/fortal/catalog.mdx`.
  Point it at `components/`. This tool feeds `docs:check`, which the `ci`
  aggregate runs, so leaving it breaks CI on the move.
- The component docs link to recipe source on GitHub by path, for example
  `docs/components/tooltip.mdx:126`. Twenty-five doc files carry such a
  link. Rewrite every `lib/src/recipes/` link
  to `lib/src/components/`. `validate_docs.dart` does not check these links,
  so grep for the old path before merging.
- Update the paths in `scripts/README.md`.
- Proof: `test/public_api_test.dart` and `public_api_compatibility_test.dart`
  unchanged and green; `melos run fortal:parity:check` green; `melos run
  docs:check` green; the color fixture test still reads every scale; no
  file in the repository outside `.context/` contains `src/recipes/` or
  `src/fortal/`.

### Commit 2: `feat(remix_fortal)`: instance style override, and only `remix` imports

Content edits on the final paths. Every default component template takes a
styler parameter merged last. No Fortal recipe does.

- Add `<Target>Styler style = const <Target>Styler.create()` as the last
  parameter of each of the 35 recipes, and `.merge(style)` as the last call.
  Mirror `packages/remix_cli/lib/src/registry/templates/button/button.dart.tmpl`.
- Twelve recipes already declare a local named `style`: `button`, `chart`,
  `code`, `divider`, `heading`, `icon_button`, `kbd`, `link`, `select`,
  `text`, `textfield`, `toggle`. Rename those locals first.
- Remove the four unused `naked_ui` imports (`accordion`, `disclosure`,
  `slider`, `tabs`; verified unused with the analyzer) and the four direct
  `mix` imports (`chart`, `base_button`, `computed`, and the theme files).
  `remix` re-exports `mix` in full. This is a precondition for Commit 4, whose
  tool refuses those imports.
- Regenerate the `.g.dart` parts. The generator adds `style` to every named
  constructor.
- Test: for Button, Checkbox, and TextField, a `style` that sets one idle
  property wins over the recipe, and a hover fragment in `style` wins over
  the recipe's hover fragment. Extend `fortal_control_matrix_test.dart` or add
  a sibling.
- Proof: `fortal:parity:check` and the package test suite.

### Commit 3: `feat(remix_cli)`: preset axis

The CLI learns that more than one registry exists. Only `default` ships in
this PR, so behavior for every existing project is unchanged. This is
independent of Commit 1 and Commit 2.

- Move `lib/src/registry/registry.yaml` and `templates/` to
  `lib/src/registry/default/`.
- `registry.dart`: a `bundledPresets` constant listing `default`;
  `loadBundled({required String preset})` resolves
  `package:remix_cli/src/registry/<preset>/registry.yaml`; an unknown preset
  fails before any file read with a message that lists the bundled presets;
  `RegistryCatalog.preset` for messages; the unknown-item error names the
  preset.
- `project_config.dart`: `preset` field; schema 2 requires the key; schema 1
  reads as `default`; `encode()` writes schema 2; preset must match
  `^[a-z][a-z0-9_]*$` and be in `bundledPresets`.
- `cli.dart`: `init --preset <name>`, default `default`.
- `installer.dart`: `RegistryLoader` becomes
  `Future<RegistryCatalog> Function(String preset)`; `add` passes
  `config.preset`; the `init` mismatch error covers prefix, preset, and UI
  path.
- Repository tools that hardcode the old path: `tool/check_open_code.dart`,
  `tool/check_open_code_dogfood.dart`, `tool/sync_registry_remix.dart`,
  `tool/check_version_alignment.dart`, `tool/validate_docs.dart`, and
  `test/tool/check_open_code_test.dart`. Point them at `registry/default/`.
  `validate_docs.dart` matters most: it feeds `docs:check`, which the `ci`
  aggregate runs, so missing it breaks CI on the move.
- Tests: schema 1 parses as default; schema 2 without `preset` fails; bad
  preset name fails; `init --preset default` writes schema 2; `init` with a
  different preset on an existing project fails; `loadBundled` with an
  unknown preset fails with the list; the installer passes the configured
  preset to the loader; `--diff` still compares against the default tree.
- Docs: the configuration section of `docs/open-code.mdx` shows the schema 2
  file and the `--preset` flag, and drops the words "no presets".
  `packages/remix_cli/CHANGELOG.md`.

### Commit 4: `feat(remix_cli)`: the Fortal preset, with its proof

Depends on Commit 1, 2, and 3. The diff is mostly derived content; review the
tool, the registry rules, and the check.

- `tool/build_registry.dart` as specified above, and
  `test/tool/build_registry_test.dart` covering the refusals, the round
  trip, the dependency inference, and `--check` on a planted drift.
- The committed output: `registry/fortal/registry.yaml` and every template.
- `bundledPresets` gains `fortal`. The `remix_cli` unit tests load the
  Fortal catalog, resolve `button` to `theme`, `base_button`, `button`,
  resolve `data_table` to its four dependencies, and rely on
  `_validateGraphAndTargets` for cycles and double-owned targets.
- Melos scripts `open-code:fortal:build` and `open-code:fortal:check`, named
  like the existing `open-code:check`. The check joins the `ci` aggregate
  next to `docs:check`. `.github/workflows/version.yml` runs
  `sync_registry_remix.dart` as a shell step after `melos version`; add the
  build right after it, because the Fortal registry copies its floors from
  the default registry.
- `tool/check_open_code.dart --preset fortal`: install every Fortal item
  into a guarded temporary Flutter app with prefix `Acme`, generate without a
  consumer `build.yaml`, analyze clean, and run a smoke test from
  `open_code/fortal_fixture/` that pumps every generated widget under
  `AcmeScope` and asserts a few resolved token values against known Radix
  3.3.0 hex values. No committed expected `.g.dart`: the package already
  commits the same adapter under the `Fortal` prefix. No equivalence test
  against `FortalButton`: the byte round trip already proves the recipe is
  the same code, the same generator produces both adapters, and a temporary
  app cannot path-depend on a `resolution: workspace` package cleanly.
- Docs: a Fortal preset section in `docs/open-code.mdx` with the install and
  the ownership boundary; `open_code/README.md`; a dated "Since" note in
  `open_code/CLEAN_SHEET.md` under "What remains outside this MVP" linking
  here; `packages/remix_cli/CHANGELOG.md`.

### Commit 5: `chore(remix_fortal)`: stop publishing

- `publish_to: none` in the pubspec. Remove the pub.dev publish notes from
  the pubspec comments and the package from any release automation that
  versions it.
- Delete the hosted-pin check in `tool/fortal_parity/check.dart` and drop
  `naked_ui` from the pubspec, which that check was the last reason to keep.
- `docs/fortal/*` install section shows `remix init --preset fortal` and
  drops `flutter pub add remix_fortal`.
- After merge: mark `remix_fortal` discontinued on pub.dev with the preset
  named as the replacement.

## Risks and how each commit bounds them

- **A `style` local collides with the new parameter.** Twelve recipes. Commit 2
  renames them; the analyzer catches any miss.
- **A file or path still contains `fortal` after Commit 1.** The derivation tool
  refuses, and Commit 4's test plants one to prove the refusal.
- **Formatter drift.** The installer formats rendered output, and wrapping
  depends on prefix length, as `check_open_code_dogfood.dart` documents. The
  drift check therefore compares the template to the source, never a rendered
  file to a template.
- **Version floors diverge between presets.** The Fortal registry copies its
  constraints from the default registry at build time, and `--check` fails
  when they differ.
- **`remix.yaml` schema 2 reaches a consumer with an older CLI.** That CLI
  rejects it with its existing "unsupported schema" error. The project-local
  dev dependency pins the CLI, which is why the docs recommend it.

## Consumer and release validation

Both registries require Remix `^1.0.0-beta.9`. Published versions through beta.8
lack the Naked UI types needed by generated Fortal adapters. The repository
prepares beta.9 with these exports. Beta.8 already provides the Sidebar panel.

`melos run open-code:check` installs every item from both presets against the
checkout. `melos run open-code:release:check` requires hosted Remix and never
falls back to the checkout. The CLI publish job depends on the hosted check.
A source/template round trip does not replace either consumer check.

The first public release also requires the CLI bootstrap and a hosted CLI
installation check. Follow [the release instructions](RELEASING.md). Keep
`remix_fortal` available until the published replacement passes those checks.

## Out of this stack

- `init --preset <x> --reinstall`, a batched `add --overwrite` for switching
  presets in place. shadcn does this. It is a later feature.
- Preset knobs at `init`, such as `--accent indigo --radius medium` written
  into the installed theme.
- Authoring the default preset as Dart with the same derivation. The default
  has no parity contract, so the pressure is lower. Reconsider after Commit 4
  shows the tool's cost.
- Deleting `registry_source/fortal` from the repository. That would make the
  `.tmpl` files the only form of Fortal, move the parity suite behind a
  temporary-app render, and force `apps/dashboard`, `apps/demo`,
  `apps/playground`, and 39 doc pages to migrate to installed source.
  Reconsider only if the apps migrate to the preset on their own.
