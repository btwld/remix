# Clean-sheet decision: application-owned UI on Remix

## The problem

Remix deliberately ships behavior without a theme. An application can use the
opinionated `remix_fortal` preset, or it can own a design language. Owning the
design language used to require copying a theme and hand-maintaining wrappers
that could fall behind the Remix constructor surface.

The MVP asks a narrower question: can an application own Theme and Button
source, keep Remix as the maintained behavior dependency, and receive a
generated forwarding adapter without adopting Fortal?

## Decision

Yes. `remix_cli` installs authored Theme and Button source into the application,
and `@MixWidget` generates the forwarding adapter there. The application edits
the visual recipe; Remix still handles the difficult behavioral contract.

The initial catalog contained only two items:

```text
theme -> button
```

Button depends on Theme. Installing Button resolves that graph in a stable
order, adds its hosted dependencies, exports the authored files, and generates
`button.g.dart` in the consumer.

**Since:** the styled component catalog has grown on the same two mechanisms —
one authored file plus one generated part per item, every item depending on
`theme`. Nothing in the decision below changed to accommodate them: no schema
field and no installer branch. The token vocabulary moved once, when the chart
item added `chart1`-`chart5` to reach the current twenty.
Compound components (a checkbox group option, a tab bar with its tabs and
panels) fit by declaring more than one `@MixWidget` in the same file. The
current catalog is listed in `docs/open-code.mdx`.

## Ownership boundary

| Remix owns | The application owns |
|---|---|
| Rendering and layout machinery | Semantic tokens and light/dark values |
| Pointer, keyboard, focus, and feedback behavior | Button variants, sizes, and visual recipe |
| Accessibility semantics | Theme, recipe, and instance customization |
| Loading and disabled interaction rules | Installed authored files |
| Naked UI delegation | The generated adapter committed by the app |
| Mix specs, stylers, variants, and resolution | |

Nothing installed by the CLI copies Remix internals or depends on Fortal.
Core component source imports the public `package:remix/remix.dart` surface.
The optional chart item also imports the public `package:mix_chart/mix_chart.dart`
surface for its data, rendering, interaction, and semantics contract.

## Why generation is part of the consumer

The recipe is a normal function returning `ButtonStyler`:

```dart
@MixWidget(name: 'AcmeButton', target: RemixButton.new)
ButtonStyler acmeButtonStyle({
  AcmeButtonVariant variant = .primary,
  AcmeButtonSize size = .medium,
  ButtonStyler style = const ButtonStyler.create(),
}) { /* recipe */ }
```

The generator combines the recipe parameters with the complete safe
`RemixButton` constructor surface. A non-nullable variant enum also produces
named constructors such as `AcmeButton.destructive`.

Default-all forwarding is intentional. A handwritten wrapper or parameter
allowlist can silently miss a new Remix capability. Regeneration instead turns
constructor changes into generated diffs that an application can review.

Two target parameters are not exposed as ordinary overrides:

- `style` is supplied by the recipe. The recipe's own `style` argument merges
  last and is the application-level override.
- `styleSpec` bypasses style resolution, including the recipe and its tokens,
  so it is not a useful visual customization hook here.

Generated source is not bundled in the registry. It is emitted from the
consumer's resolved Remix and generator versions, then compared with a
committed Acme fixture in this repository to make drift visible.

## Why a small local catalog

The MVP has one registry YAML file and one canonical template tree inside
`remix_cli`. It has no remote registry, cache, lockfile, content hashes, update
protocol, or per-component manifest format. Those features need evidence from
more components and real consumers before they earn their maintenance cost.

The installer still protects application source:

- existing authored files are preserved on normal runs;
- `--diff` is read-only;
- `--overwrite` applies only to the item explicitly requested;
- dependency declarations that already resolve compatibly are preserved;
- validation and dependency failures happen before authored-source writes;
- generation targets the parts declared by resolved items, plus every
  already-installed adapter, so adding one item cannot delete another
  item's generated part.

This is enough distribution machinery for a growing catalog without pretending
the MVP has an update system.

## Dependency cost

Runtime dependencies are `remix` and `mix_annotations`. Mix and Naked UI arrive
through Remix, which avoids choosing a direct Mix version that Remix was not
compiled against. Installing the optional chart item adds `mix_chart` directly;
it never adds `remix_fortal`. Development dependencies are `build_runner` and
`mix_generator`.

Chart is deliberately one item with three adapters. `mix_chart` owns the hard
chart contract. The installed file owns presentation and resolves theme
tokens only: `background`, `foreground`, `mutedForeground`, `border`, `radius`,
and the five `chart1`-`chart5` entries the chart item added to the vocabulary.
A theme installed before those five existed does not carry them, and authored
files are preserved on normal runs, so such a theme needs them added by hand.

The recurring costs are visible:

- recipe, Remix constructor, or generator changes require regeneration;
- Remix prerelease changes can rewrite the generated adapter;
- the installed layer intentionally relies on Remix's Mix re-export;
- compact 32/36/40px sizes suit web density but are below common mobile touch
  target guidance, so adopting apps must make their own density decision.

## What remains outside this MVP

**Since 2026-09-04:** Fortal is available as a second application-owned preset.
Its separate source tree, derivation contract, and publication transition are
recorded in [Presets: Fortal as application-owned source](PRESETS.md). There is
still no general component marketplace, remote registry, automatic migration,
or source lockfile. The CLI now has a tag-based publish workflow with a
hosted consumer check.

The first public release still requires package bootstrap and hosted CLI
verification. Until then, use a checkout or staged package with checkout Remix.
The [release instructions](RELEASING.md) define the order and required checks.


## Agent source distribution

Both catalogs include eight domain-specific Agent surfaces. Unlike visual
`@MixWidget` recipes, these copy the private authoring package's
(`registry_source/agent`) behavior and empty anatomy specs into the
application, and each preset styles them through recipes authored in its own
source package. They still compose the
public Remix primitives; they do not copy Remix internals or introduce a
private runtime dependency. Applications own the installed domain behavior as
well as its appearance. The scope of future source-update diffs includes that
behavior.

The supported Mix spec-styler builder is opt-in, so these installs enable it
for their source paths in consumer `build.yaml`. This is a deliberate extension
to the original recipe-only, no-build-config contract. Existing configuration
is preserved, conflicts are rejected during preflight, and configuration changes
appear in dry-run/diff. Registry schema and preset selection are unchanged.
