/// The application's Link recipe.
///
/// Remix owns the link role, the destination, focus, activation, and the rule
/// that a link with no callback is a disabled link; this recipe supplies only
/// its color and its underline.
///
/// It sets no font size on purpose. A link is inline text, so it should take
/// the size and weight of the paragraph around it — a fixed size here would
/// make a link inside a heading render at body scale.
///
/// The color is `foreground`, not `primary`. This theme's `primary` is a
/// near-neutral fill color rather than a link hue, so a `primary` link would
/// read as body text with no affordance at all. Underlining is what marks it,
/// which also means the link is still identifiable without color — an
/// application that has a brand link color changes the two `.color(...)` calls
/// below.
///
/// There is no pressed fragment. A link's press is over in the time it takes
/// to navigate, and the destination arriving is the feedback — the same reason
/// the checkbox has none, arrived at from the other direction: a checkbox
/// flips its own state, and a link replaces the page.
///
/// [style] is merged **last**, so a single call site can override any part of
/// the resolved recipe without forking it. State fragments merge by state, not
/// by depth: an override that must beat the recipe's hover color has to be
/// declared as a hover fragment too (`LinkStyler().onHovered(...)`).
