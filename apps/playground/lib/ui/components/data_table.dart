/// The application's DataTable recipe.
///
/// Remix owns the rendering, sorting, selection, pagination, the empty state,
/// and the table accessibility semantics; this recipe supplies the frame, the
/// rows, the cells, and the three text roles.
///
/// It is the one recipe in this layer that **depends on other items**, and it
/// is the reason its registry entry lists `checkbox`, `icon_button`, and
/// `select` beside `theme`. A table's selection column is a checkbox, its
/// pager is a pair of icon buttons, and its page-size control is a select —
/// literally, not by analogy. `DataTableSpec` takes each of those as a styler,
/// so the honest thing is to hand it the application's own recipes rather than
/// restate three components inside a fourth. Change the checkbox recipe and
/// this table's checkboxes change with it, which is what a reader expects.
///
/// That is a deliberate exception to the rule that these files are
/// self-contained. It earns it: the alternative is either three duplicated
/// recipes that drift, or a table whose controls do not match the rest of the
/// application.
///
/// The frame is the card's: `background` fill, `border` hairline, the theme
/// radius. Header and body rows are separated by the same hairline, and the
/// last body row drops it so the table does not draw a second line on top of
/// its own bottom edge.
///
/// [style] is merged **last**, so a single call site can override any part of
/// the resolved recipe without forking it.
