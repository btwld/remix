/// The application's Dialog recipe.
///
/// Remix owns the rendering, the modal barrier, focus trapping, the escape
/// and barrier dismissal rules, and the dialog accessibility semantics; this
/// recipe supplies the panel, the two text roles, and the action row.
///
/// It is a popover with a title: the same `background` fill, `border`
/// hairline, and lift, sized wider and padded more because a dialog holds a
/// decision rather than a control. The two are deliberately separate files —
/// they have separate update stories, and sharing a surface helper would make
/// every change to one a change to the other.
///
/// [style] is merged **last**, so a single call site can override any part of
/// the resolved recipe without forking it.
