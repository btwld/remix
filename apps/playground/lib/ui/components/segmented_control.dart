/// The application's SegmentedControl recipe.
///
/// A segmented control is one control divided into parts, which is what
/// separates it from a toggle group: the segments share a track, exactly one
/// is chosen, and the chosen one is *lifted* out of the track rather than
/// tinted on top of it. Remix owns the rendering, the equal-width layout, the
/// roving focus, and the group accessibility semantics.
///
/// One recipe covers the track and the segments, because
/// `SegmentedControlSpec` carries the segment's style as a field: the
/// control's `item` is the default every `RemixSegmentedControlItem` resolves
/// against, so a segment in a loop cannot be left unstyled.
///
/// It takes no variant. The whole point of the component is one shape — a
/// recessed track with a raised current segment — and a second look would be
/// a toggle group wearing the wrong name.
///
/// [style] is merged **last**, so a single call site can override any part of
/// the resolved recipe without forking it.
