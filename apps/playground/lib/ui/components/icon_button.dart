/// Everything visual about an icon button lives in this function: geometry,
/// the five variants, and the hover/pressed/focus/disabled fragments. Remix
/// keeps ownership of rendering, pointer and keyboard behavior, accessibility
/// semantics, and the loading/disabled interaction rules — this recipe never
/// reimplements any of that.
///
/// It restates the button's metrics and dimming rather than sharing them.
/// That is deliberate: the two components have separate update stories, and a
/// shared table would make every change to one a change to the other. A
/// five-line record is cheaper to duplicate than to couple.
///
/// `RemixIconButton` requires a `semanticLabel` because an icon has no
/// accessible name of its own. That is a Remix rule, not a recipe choice, and
/// it is why the generated widget has one required named argument beyond the
/// icon.
///
/// [style] is merged **last**, so a single call site can override any part of
/// the resolved recipe without forking it. Because [variant] is a non-nullable
/// enum, the generator also emits one named constructor per enum value.
///
/// State fragments merge by state, not by depth: an override that must beat
/// the recipe's hover fill has to be declared as a hover fragment too
/// (`IconButtonStyler().onHovered(...)`).
