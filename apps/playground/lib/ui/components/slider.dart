/// The application's Slider recipe.
///
/// Remix owns the rendering, the drag and keyboard behavior, the mapping from
/// a 0-1 value onto the filled range, and the slider accessibility semantics;
/// this recipe supplies the rail, the filled range, and the thumb.
///
/// The rail is `muted` and the range is `primary`, the same pairing the
/// progress bar uses — a slider is a progress bar you can grab, and reading
/// them as one family is worth more than distinguishing them by color.
///
/// `semanticFormatterCallback` is deliberately not forwarded to the generated
/// `PlaygroundSlider`. Its type is
/// `NakedSliderSemanticFormatterCallback`, which comes from
/// `package:naked_ui` — a package this layer does not depend on. Reach for
/// `RemixSlider` directly on the rare call site that needs to reword the
/// announced value.
///
/// [style] is merged **last**, so a single call site can override any part of
/// the resolved recipe without forking it. State fragments merge by state, not
/// by depth: an override that must beat the recipe's hover thumb has to be
/// declared as a hover fragment too (`SliderStyler().onHovered(...)`).
