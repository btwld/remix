/// The application's tab-strip recipe.
///
/// The strip is the rule the tabs sit on: one hairline along its bottom edge,
/// in the same `border` token every other control outline uses. It spans its
/// container rather than hugging the tabs, so the rule lines up with the card
/// or page edge beside it.
///
/// The strip does not scroll. Tabs wider than the container are a layout
/// decision, and the scroll view belongs **outside** the bar:
///
/// ```dart
/// SingleChildScrollView(
///   scrollDirection: Axis.horizontal,
///   child: PlaygroundTabBar(child: Row(children: tabs)),
/// )
/// ```
///
/// Not inside it. Flutter's tab-bar semantics role requires every direct
/// semantics child of the bar to be a tab, and a scroll view inserted between
/// them adds a node of its own, which trips that assertion at runtime.
///
/// `RemixTabs` — the behavioral root that owns selection, roving focus, and
/// arrow-key traversal — carries no styler and therefore no recipe. Compose it
/// directly around this bar:
///
/// ```dart
/// RemixTabs(
///   selectedTabId: tab,
///   onChanged: (id) => setState(() => tab = id),
///   child: Column(
///     children: [
///       PlaygroundTabBar(
///         child: Row(children: [
///           PlaygroundTab(tabId: 'account', label: 'Account'),
///           PlaygroundTab(tabId: 'billing', label: 'Billing'),
///         ]),
///       ),
///       PlaygroundTabView(tabId: 'account', child: accountPanel),
///       PlaygroundTabView(tabId: 'billing', child: billingPanel),
///     ],
///   ),
/// )
/// ```

///

/// every state and merely transparent when unselected, so selecting a tab
/// paints two pixels instead of reflowing the whole strip.

/// the resolved recipe without forking it. State fragments merge by state, not
/// by depth: an override that must beat the recipe's selected underline has to
/// be declared as a selected fragment too (`TabStyler().onSelected(...)`).

/// `PlaygroundTab`. Its type is `ValueWidgetBuilder<NakedTabState>`, and

/// directly on the rare call site that needs the raw state.
