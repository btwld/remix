/// The application's Sidebar recipe.
///
/// A sidebar is the navigation panel down one edge of an application shell.
/// Remix owns the rendering, the header/content/footer stacking, Tab traversal
/// across destinations, the selection semantics, and the navigation
/// landmark; this recipe owns the panel surface, the region insets, the
/// section rhythm, and the label type.
///
/// It takes no variant and no size. There is one panel per shell, and the
/// thing that actually varies between applications — how wide it is — is not
/// the recipe's to decide: the host sizes the panel, because the same panel
/// is usually presented as a drawer at narrow widths and the drawer's width
/// is a layout decision. Nothing here sets a width, and nothing here pads the
/// header, whose metrics normally have to line up with an application top bar.
///
/// This recipe **depends on the `toggle` and `tooltip` items**, which is why
/// its registry entry lists both beside `theme`. A destination is a toggle: it
/// is a control that stays pressed, and `SidebarSpec` takes its style as a
/// `ToggleStyler` field. Handing it the application's own ghost toggle recipe
/// is what keeps a selected destination and a selected toggle the same colour
/// without restating one component inside another. The same reasoning covers
/// the tooltip: when the host collapses the panel to an icon rail, each
/// destination's label appears in the application's own tooltip recipe.
///
/// The panel fill is `background`, the same token the page uses, and the
/// trailing hairline in `border` is what separates the two — the same choice
/// the card recipe makes, for the same reason.
///
/// [style] is merged **last**, so a single call site can override any part of
/// the resolved recipe without forking it:
///
/// ```dart
/// PlaygroundSidebar(
///   style: SidebarStyler().width(_shellSidebarWidth),
///   sections: sections,
///   selectedValue: current,
///   onSelected: go,
/// )
/// ```
