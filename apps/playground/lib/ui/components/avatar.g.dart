/// The application's Avatar recipe.
///
/// Remix owns the fallback chain — image, then label, then icon — and the
/// clipping; this recipe supplies the circle, the neutral surface behind it,
/// and the scale of whatever fallback shows through.
///
/// The surface is `muted`, so an avatar with no image reads as a placeholder
/// rather than as a filled control. An image covers all of it, which is why
/// the fill only ever shows in the fallback case. The recipe sets no
/// alignment: Remix already centers whichever fallback it renders.
///
/// The fallback takes `foreground`, not `mutedForeground`. Initials are the
/// content — they name a person — and `mutedForeground` on `muted` measures
/// 4.35:1 in the shipped light theme, under the 4.5:1 WCAG floor for text
/// this size. `mutedForeground` remains correct for the markers that pair
/// with it elsewhere; it is not a color to set names in.
///
/// The shape is a full circle rather than the theme's control radius. An
/// avatar stands for a person or an organisation, and that is a circle in
/// every system this application is likely to sit beside; a theme that wants
/// squircles overrides `borderRadius` in one place.
///
/// [style] is merged **last**, so a single call site can override any part of
/// the resolved recipe without forking it.
