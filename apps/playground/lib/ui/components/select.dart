/// The application's Select recipe.
///
/// Remix owns the rendering, the overlay, keyboard traversal, the open and
/// close behavior, and the listbox accessibility semantics; this recipe
/// supplies the trigger, the floating panel, and the option rows.
///
/// One recipe covers all three, because `SelectSpec` carries them as fields:
/// `trigger`, `content` with `menuContainer`, and `item`. An option in a loop
/// therefore cannot be left unstyled.
///
/// The trigger is styled as a field rather than as a button — same border,
/// same radius, same heights as the text field — because that is what it is.
/// The panel matches the menu's, so a select and a menu opened side by side
/// do not read as two systems.
///
/// [style] is merged **last**, so a single call site can override any part of
/// the resolved recipe without forking it. State fragments merge by state, not
/// by depth: an override that must beat the trigger's focus ring has to be
/// declared as a focus fragment too.
