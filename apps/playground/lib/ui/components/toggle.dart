/// A toggle is a button that stays pressed. Remix owns the rendering, the

/// the geometry and the off/hover/on/focus/disabled fragments.
///
/// The on state is `accent`, the token whose whole job is "this transparent
/// control is doing something", while hover is the quieter `muted`. Keeping
/// them different is what lets a reader tell a toggle they are pointing at
/// from one that is switched on.
///
/// [style] is merged **last**, so a single call site can override any part of
/// the resolved recipe without forking it. Because [variant] is a non-nullable
/// enum, the generator also emits one named constructor per enum value.
///
/// State fragments merge by state, not by depth: an override that must beat
/// the recipe's on fill has to be declared as a selected fragment too
/// (`ToggleStyler().onSelected(...)`).
