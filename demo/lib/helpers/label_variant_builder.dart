// Note: This file is commented out as it's incompatible with Mix 2.0
// Mix 2.0 has redesigned the Variant API - Variant no longer has a 'name' property.
// This function would need to be redesigned if variant label building is needed.

// import 'package:mix/mix.dart';
// String variantLabelBuilder(Variant value) => value.name.split('.').last;
