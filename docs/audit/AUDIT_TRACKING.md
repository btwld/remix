## Critical Issues to Address

### 🔴 High Priority (Before Production)

1. **RemixSelect Component**
   - Split into separate single/multi-select components
   - Remove deprecated callbacks
   - Reduce complexity (violates SRP)

2. **RemixTextField Component**
   - Simplify widget hierarchy
   - Fix over-engineered hint text implementation
   - Improve state management

3. **Test Coverage**
   - Current: 28.9% → Target: 80%
   - 12 components have no tests at all
   - Fix failing focus management test

4. **Accessibility**
   - Only 2/19 components implement Semantics
   - Add screen reader support to all interactive components
   - Implement keyboard navigation

### 🟡 Medium Priority

1. **Code Quality**
   - Consolidate animation logic in slider
   - Standardize focus node management
   - Remove deprecated parameters

2. **Documentation**
   - Add usage examples for all components
   - Create migration guides
   - Document accessibility features
