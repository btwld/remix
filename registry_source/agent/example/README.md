# Remix Agent catalog

Local review surface for every unpublished `remix_agent` widget. Host chrome
only — the package still ships no theme.

```bash
cd registry_source/agent/example
fvm flutter run -d chrome
# or
fvm flutter run -d web-server --web-hostname localhost --web-port 7388
```

Day / Night switches the Composer's installed `UiThemeScope` and the local
styles used by the other seven surfaces. The Agent package contributes no
visual defaults. The catalog uses a fixed two-column wide layout at 880 logical
pixels and a single-column narrow layout below that breakpoint.

The hero is a full turn. The rail jumps to Composer, Message, Transcript,
Permission, Execution, Plan, Activity, and Answer. Each section is a live
control, not a screenshot. The composed run uses the page scroll so every
permission decision stays visible. Allow or deny the mock command, finish or stop it, and submit a new
message to replay. It never invokes a terminal or model.

The registry-installed Button recipe also supplies catalog and permission
actions. Composer controls add 48px touch geometry through the recipe override
slots; the installed source remains unchanged.

The catalog recipes pass Remix child stylers separately from structural Agent
stylers. A shared chevron builder adds Mix rotation to disclosure
indicators; other glyphs use Agent's defaults. Top-bar and rail actions are
Remix controls, so the same catalog can be reviewed with pointer or keyboard.

`motion.dart` keeps animation choices in the application: 120ms control feedback
and 200ms chevron and turn-item entrances. The latter fade and move 8px without
changing layout; request keys prevent replay during status updates. Reduced
motion renders the final state immediately. Disclosure panels reuse Remix's
existing fade/size transition and reduced-motion handling.
